This is the Full Stack Application- "Coachin Class", it has two type of user - admin and student. They have different access.
Flow starts with Admin, uploading question paper from the upload page. I have given the format of question paper. Then the student can login and take the test from the Paper page. Then admin can evaluate the answersheets. Once evaluated they can view the result in the reports page. In the reports page they can click on the student name to view the analysis and also see the marksheets.
You can create student users but there is only one Admin user.

Here are the sample users and the credentials :

username: admin@
password: admin

username: kayn@gmail.com
password: kayn

username: trynd@gmail.com
password: trynd

npm -v
6.14.15
node -v
v14.18.0
